I am Sam Johnson, a software engineer with over 10 years of experience. From large to small companies I have worked on all sides of application development.


My mom got me involved at computers at a young age. She signed me up for a Pascal class when I was in the 6th grade. I was hooked, and I haven't looked back since.


Currently I am learning japanese (recently passed the N3 exam) and am working at a small Japanese startup called Autify. I want this blog to be a place where I talk about programming, learning Japanese, and my life.


Thanks for reading :D
