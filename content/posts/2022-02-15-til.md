It's a common use case to want to create a random password for a new service -- such as an RDS database -- inside of terraform. Terraform actually allows for a very simple way to handle these using the [random provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest/docs/resources/password). This will create a new password only on resource _creation_ saving the value into the statefile. This means the password will be created the first time you run `terraform apply`, and each subsequent time the password will not change.

Heres an example using [AWS Systems Manager](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/ssm_parameter) which adds a secure way to store secrets.

```javascript
resource "random_password" "password" {
  length  = 63
  special = false
}

resource "aws_ssm_parameter" "db_password" {
  name  = "/prd/db-password"
  type  = "SecureString"
  value = random_password.password.result
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "db" {
  username               = "great new db"
  password               = aws_ssm_parameter.db_password.value
}
```


Now I don't really need to store the db password in SSM, I could just pass it directly to the db instance. But SSM provides a way for me to easily update the parameter after it is created. Additionally, I will probably need to view the paramter later on. SSM is a great way to securely provide secrets to your application running on AWS as well.
